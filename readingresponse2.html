                In the first episode of “Ways of Seeing,” I just felt like John Berger was being a camera hater for most of it. The main topic he goes over is the act of reproducing art through camera — more specifically, cameras allow paintings to be transmittable. Berger believes that the camera can modify the meaning of certain paintings, and states that cameras are “maipulat[ing] and transform[ing]” the meaning behind paintings. Despite this rather negative talk, I really resonate with his opinions especially since I do agree that going to museums and seeing art up close is incomparable to seeing it on a laptop screen.

                I also appreciated how he interviewed various women for his second episode about their stance on nude paintings in traditional European oil paintings. I especially relate to when the conversation shifts to talking about how we perceive ourselves. Even though this TV series was broadcasted in the 70’s, I still feel like the discourse in this episode is still relevant today. This one interviewee in the show talked about how she always perceives herself as the image of who she wishes to be. I felt this way because I believe social media has amplified this “feeling of inadequacy” when we compare the image we present ourselves to social media to others. We always seem to compare ourselves to other people's lives and we have higher expectations of ourselves to fulfill a role that we currently do not fit in.

                I thought the main topics presented in episodes 3 and 4 were overlapping (in regards to how merchandise/publicity photos were in many ways influenced by oil paintings of wealth and prosperity). I feel like advertisements have only gotten more manipulative over time as there’s now ad personalization, and it just makes it easier for consumers to buy products they really don’t need.
