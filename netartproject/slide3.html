			<h1>VIDUR'S REACTION</h1>
			<p>- Going through The File Room, is a similar experience to going down a YouTube spiral about something you didn’t know about, but shocks you. It’s sort of unending. </p>
			<p>- It really makes your realize the omnipresence of censorship in our lives, and how more often that you think you’re seeing and thinking something because someone designed it to be that way </p>
			<p>- The layout of the work as a sort of archive/data base artistically, in the sense that the interface allows you to go down that spiral, and that feeling really reinforces how prevalent government censorship is in our lives, whether we realize that or not. </p>
