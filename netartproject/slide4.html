			<h1>JUSTINE'S REACTION</h1>
			<p>- I really like the robust look and feel of the website â€” it was straight forward and very easy to navigate</p>
           		<p>- I was surprised to see many archived cases, especially those from well known artists</p>
			<p>- Certain lists would go on for a really long time, and it was eye opening to be scrolling through so many censored cases</p>
