	<h1>ABOUT THE EXHIBITION: THE FILE ROOM</h1>
	<p>- The File Room is an open-ended online database created in 1994 that presents past cases of censorship around the world</p>
	<p>- The purpose of the exhibition was to reintroduce suppressed material back into the public</p>
	<p>- The layout of the web interface was quite “somber” and “bureaucratic” as it was full of dark blue colors and there was minimal text & images filling the page</p>
	<p> - The exhibition layout was simple: at the center of a dark room, visitors can access a computer stacked with archives of censorship cases </p>
