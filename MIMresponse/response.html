                 This book just made me very hyper-aware of my obsession with technology, and I honestly needed to also watch the film (which was produced in 1965, crazy!) because concepts in the book were just hard to comprehend.
              
                 I really resonated with the section talking about private identity and there being a “global village.” It seems like technology is altering the meaning of what private identity means to certain people, as many people are comfortable sharing many parts of their lives with the internet (like influencers and social media stars). 
                
                  There was a part in the film where McLuhan talks about how there's an education crisis, and that kids are learning about specialized jobs because of technology spreading information. This is something that resonated with me because the internet is honestly the reason how I knew about the IDM program & just how there's an art/science curriculum out there. Never knew stuff like this even existed until the end of high school.
