                I thought “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush was a surprising yet relatable reading for me. I was impressed with Bush’s predictions of the future with technology and how accurate they are today. For instance, he was predicting that cameras in the future would be comprised of “… faster material and lenses… and finer-grained sensitive compounds to allow an extension of the mini-camera idea.” Looking at the cameras we have today, there are expensive digital cameras on the market that do what he predicted, and there are even micro-cameras like Go-Pro that shoot in 4k quality despite the small build. I found this reading to be relatable since I also question a lot about how technology now will further advance. Because of how far technology has advanced even in these past 40 years, I often get wary of how technology in the future will be unsafe or dangerous to use (maybe because I watch too much Black Mirror). Yet, I think that Bush’s insight on the “need to constantly improve, even in today’s age” makes me rethink the positive outcomes of the future when it comes to technology advancements.

                In his article “Long Live The Web” by Tim-Berners Lee, I connected with a lot of his opinions, especially when it comes to how the Web is being threatened in different ways. He states that “some of its most successful inhabitants have begun to chip away at its principles.” I often worry about how the Web will turn out to be in the next 10-20 years — will it be a safe space to interact with and work from?  Despite that I believe that my hopes trump my fears over the future of the Web because it has provided so many new opportunities and new information across the globe in many different communities. I am glad Lee provided readers with the motivation to keep the Web’s principles intact as he states, “We the public, the scientific community and the press must make sure the Web’s principles remain intact—not just to preserve what we have gained but to benefit from the great advances that are still to come.”
